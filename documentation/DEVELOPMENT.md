# Development Environment

## Requirements
* node v14.15.0+
* [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.16

## Quick Start
If you wish to work on the go-lambda-cleanup CLI, you'll first need Go installed on your machine (please check the requirements before proceeding).

Note: This project uses Go Modules making it safe to work with it outside of your existing GOPATH. The instructions that follow assume a directory in your home directory outside of the standard GOPATH.
